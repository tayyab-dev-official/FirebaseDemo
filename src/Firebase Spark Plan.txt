Yes, both Firebase Authentication (with email/password and Google sign-in) and Cloud Firestore are available as free services under the Firebase Spark plan, subject to generous usage limits. 

Firebase Authentication
Email/Password and Google Sign-in: These are considered part of the "no-cost" Firebase products and are largely free to use, even in production, up to a significant threshold of 50,000 Monthly Active Users (MAUs).

Paid features: The primary exception is Phone Authentication (SMS verification), which costs money per verification from the first use (though there may be a small daily or monthly free testing quota).

Exceeding Limits: If your app exceeds 50,000 MAUs, your project automatically transitions to the Google Cloud Identity Platform's pay-as-you-go pricing, but the first 50,000 MAUs are still free.

Firebase Cloud Firestore 
Free Quotas: Cloud Firestore has a free quota of usage on both the free Spark plan and the paid Blaze plan. As long as you stay within these limits, it is a free service.

Key Free Limits (per project):
Stored data: 1 GiB total.
Document reads: 50,000 per day.
Document writes: 20,000 per day.
Document deletes: 20,000 per day.
Outbound network traffic: 10 GiB per month.

Exceeding Limits: If you exceed the limits on the free Spark plan, the service will be disabled for the remainder of the month unless you upgrade to the pay-as-you-go Blaze plan. On the Blaze plan, you are simply billed for usage above the free quotas. 

For detailed information on all of the services and their specific limits, you can refer to the official Firebase pricing page.
